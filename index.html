        	The O Driscolol crest has a black (sable) galley on a white (argent) background. The galley represents the O Driscoll maritime power, while the furled represents constancy. The cormorant overhead is the emblem of Charity, while the white background signifies Peace and Sincerity..

		    	Attending an O Driscoll Clan Gathering weekend at the end of June each
				year is a significant experience for all who bear any form of the name
				- Ó Drisceoil, O Driscoll, Driskell or Driskill. People with these and
				other forms of the O Driscoll surname around the world most likely
				have their ancestral connections, stretching back over several
				centuries to a specific part of County Cork, Ireland.  Clann Ó
				Drisceoil, or the O Driscoll Clan, have, for some 1,500 years, been
				anchored in the ancient district of Corcu Loígde, now known as
				Carbery, in West Cork. Today the area around Baltimore and the islands
				of Cape Clear, Heir and Sherkin is accepted as being the heart of the
				ancestral homeland of the worldwide O Driscoll family. For Map of O

				A successful Clan Gathering of the O Driscolls took place at Baltimore
				in 1961, and was revived some twenty-five years later, in 1986, going
				on to become, yearly since then, a four-day event, taking place during
				the last weekend of June. It is during this gathering that clan
				members choose their chieftain, who coordinates the affairs of the
				clan and hosts their ceremonial events for a period of two years. As
				the choosing of the modern-day O Driscoll Chieftain is not based on
				historical descent, any person descended from someone who bore the
				name Ó Drisceoil / Driscoll is eligible to be chosen and to hold
				office for two years.
