		Cape Clear island, Co. Cork is at the heart of the territory over
		which the O Driscolls held sway for centuries. The Island Museum
		there, has annually participated in the programme of events of the
		Annual O Driscoll Clan Gathering re-established in 1986 by an
		enthusiastic and efficient committee headed by Bernard O Driscoll of
		Baltimore.
	</p><br>

	<p>
		The O Driscoll Clan Gathering members annually visit both Cape Clear
		and Sherkin islands on O Driscoll Heritage day trips. During the visit
		to Cape Clear the Clan have an opportunity to visit early Christian
		sites, view the ruin of Dún an Óir, O Driscoll Castle, visit the O
		Driscoll Memorial Archive and participate in the International O
		Driscoll Remembrance Ceremony.

			On the occasion of the 25th Anniversary of the O Driscoll Clan
			Gathering in 2011, the O Driscoll Heritage Exhibition was mounted at
			Cape Clear Island Museum. A plaque celebrating O Driscoll Worldwide
			Heritage was unveiled by Bernadette O Driscoll of Baltimore. O
			Driscoll related documentation from The O Driscoll Collection compiled
			over a number years by Dr. Éamon Lankford was also exhibited.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="th-text">
		<p>
			The 2011 event gave impetus to a renewed consideration of their family
			history by clan members. It was decided, to establish an O Driscoll
			International Memorial Archive, to house and preserve the material, at
			Cape Clear island, part of the ancestral homeland of each member of
			today’s worldwide O Driscoll family.  A voluntary international
			advisory council and support group of O Driscoll friends from around
			the world was soon set up, to spearhead the encouragement of further
			participation in the recording of family history for inclusion in the
			archive. To this end, the www.odriscoll.ie website was created.  All
			submissions received are presented both in bound volume and digital
			format and collectively in the archive called The O Driscoll
			Collection.
		</p>

		<p>
			Former chieftains of the O Driscoll Clan Gathering have been invited
			to become patrons of the O Driscoll Memorial Archive with Éamon
			Lankford continuing to act as voluntary director. The collecting,
			archiving and preservation of the family story of O Driscolls
			worldwide and the affording of an opportunity to O Driscoll family
			members to remember their deceased loved ones in their ancestral West
			Cork homeland will continue to be a work in progress for many years to
			come.
			The archive was inaugurated by West Cork man Seán O Driscoll, a native
			of Drimoleague, Co. Cork, during the clan gathering of 2013, with the
			objective of remembering, honouring and uniting all who form the
			worldwide O Driscoll family, past and present.

	<div class="th-text">
		<p>
			The gathering of some of the O Driscoll Clan story by Éamon Lankford
			began in September 1986 when the O Driscoll Clan Gathering had been
			re-established. Marie Driscoll and her husband the late Jim Greaney
			from Hastings New Zealand visited Baltimore and happened to visit
			Buske’s Bar in the Village for a morning coffee. There, Marie picked
			up a form issued by Éamon Lankford seeking information on people named
			O Driscoll. In response she compiled and submitted very interesting
			information on her family roots, as well as some of their more recent
			history Her compilation was to be the first step in what, over the
			years since 1986, has become The O Driscoll Collection for the O
			Driscoll International Memorial Archive.
		</p>

		<p>
			Having been closely associated with the O Driscoll Clan Gathering
			since its inception in 1986, Dr. Éamon Lankford has been gathering
			documentation relating to the lives of people named O Driscoll at home
			in Ireland and throughout the world.  His absorbing account of the
			fortunes of the Clan in O Driscolls, Past and Present (2005/ updated,
			enlarged and republished in 2019) is a comprehensive historical
			account which highlights the local West Cork origins of the O
			Driscolls, as well as their power, wealth and influence down the
			centuries. It also tries to show their wider international and
			national connections. The constant maritime theme gets particular
			mention, as well as ecclesiastical, literary and legal ones that have
			characterised the recorded activities of O Driscolls through the ages.

<div class="th-text">
		<p>
			Such was the O Driscoll related material gathered over the years, it
			was in 2013 prudent to take steps to see to its longterm maintenance
			and preservation in the ancestral home place of the international O
			Driscoll family of today. The
			O Driscoll International Memorial Archive at Cape Clear island is
			dedicated to remembering, honouring and celebrating the lives of all O
			Driscolls, past, present and of others yet to come.
			O Driscolls worldwide now and in the years to come are invited to
			submit to the O Driscoll Archive, an account of their family story,
			past and present.  The donation of a copy of any O Driscoll
			documentation, published or unpublished or material placed on the
			internet which relates to anyone descended from an O Driscoll
			worldwide, past and present will also  be much appreciated anytime. It
			will be preserved in the name of the donor for future O Driscoll
			family research purposes only.
			It is the story of the O Driscolls of today that will in The O
			Driscoll Collection  provide for generations, the ‘footprints’ for
			your descendants to follow. All who have written and those who have
			yet to write a submission of some of their day to day family story for
			inclusion in the O Driscoll Memorial Archive are assured of being
			remembered. Your descendants will remember you for your thoughfulness.
			In times to come, scholars, researchers and families  -communities,
			will thank you. You and your family deserve to be remembered .

	<p style="color: brown; text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 20px;"><b>O Driscoll Clan Annual Remembrance Ceremony</b></p>

<div class="th-text">
	<p>
		With the launch of the O Driscoll Memorial Archive in 2013, former O
		Driscoll Clan Gathering Chieftain Bruce O Driscoll of Canada was
		invited to bring a candle from New Brunswick to be called The O
		Driscoll Candle, which was used in a moving Remembrance Ceremony
		during the 2013 O Driscoll Clan Gathering 2013. A candle representing
		all who emigrated from Ireland during the terrible Great Famine of
		1845-47 was brought to Cape Clear for the Famine Remembrance
		Exhibition of 1995 by James J. O Driscoll of Long Island, New York.
		This candle is lit at the start of the Annual O Driscoll Remembrance
		Ceremony when some person from a selected country across the world who
		has O Driscoll ancestry is invited to bring a candle : The O Driscoll
		Candle from their home country and give a brief account of their
		Driscoll family story and heritage.
	</p>

	<p>
		The O Driscoll Remembrance Ceremony honours, remembers and celebrates
		the lives of all who are descended from an O Driscoll who themselves
		are descended from some person named Ó Drisceoil who at one time lived
		on O Driscoll held lands in West Cork. The O Driscolls of West Cork
		are in turn descended from the Corcu Loígde tribe among whom were St.
		Ciarán, born in Cape Clear island and St. Fachtna of Ros Cairbre /
		Rosscarbery. All are remembered at the Annual O Driscoll Remembrance
		Ceremony and all are welcome to attend.
	</p>
		If unable to attend the Clan Gathering one can still participate in
		the meaningful ceremony. Members of the O Driscoll Memorial committee
		along with former O Driscoll Chieftains will respectfully call the
		names of a loved one on their behalf at the next International O
		Driscoll Memorial Archive Remembrance Ceremony. To participate in the
		ceremony click here(NOT DONE NOT DONE) please.

		In the quiet of the O Driscoll Archive, housed in a restored old

		doing let their relatives ‘live again’ for a short while among their
		own people in a part of the lands of their ancestors.
