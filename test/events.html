	<p style="color: brown; text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 20px;"><b>O Driscoll Clan Gathering Events</b></p>

	<p>
		The O Driscoll Clan Gathering committee at Baltimore organise the
		mid-summer programme of events for the annual international O Driscoll
		Clan Gathering. It is a three day Friday to late Sunday event over the
		last weekend in the month of June. Activities take place in and around
		the ancestral home area of the O Driscolls, the Village of Baltimore
		and the offshore islands of Cape Clear, Heir and Sherkin in West
		County Cork, Ireland.
	</p>

	<p>
		The annual programme of events includes a reception where people first
		get to know others in the international O Driscoll family; There is
		the Signing of the O Driscoll Register and a short  talk on some
		aspect of O Driscoll heritage in Baltimore Castle; There could
		perhaps, be a book launch or an exhibition; story-telling and singing
		sessions. Visits to historic sites and the ruins of one time O
		Driscoll castles and other places associated with O Driscolls of other
		days all regularly feature on the weekend programme.
	</p>

	<p>
		Early arriving visitors may choose to take an afternoon or evening
		sightseeing boat trip around Baltimore Harbour or take the trip to
		Fastnet Rock with its magnificent Fastnet Lighthouse. Music sessions
		in pubs and entertainment take place each evening in the Village
		Square underneath the beautifully restored Dún na Séad, Baltimore
		Castle that was for centuries, the home of the O Driscoll Clan
		Chieftains.
	</p>

	<p>
		While attending The Clan Gathering, O Driscoll visitors are at home in
		West Cork where the folk memory of times past and family genealogy is
		still very much alive. Being in the company of so many other O
		Driscolls and in their ancestral home place is often the springboard
		for many to go in search of their roots. The O Driscoll Memorial
		Archive at Cape Clear island is dedicated to the collection and
		archiving of documentation relating to members of the worldwide O
		Driscoll family.  The Skibbereen Heritage Centre and Cork County
		Library, Local Studies Unit will always provide assistance to people
		in search of their O Driscoll roots. Talking about your Driscoll
		ancestry to the locals in any part of West Cork will usually bring a
		friendly and informative response.
	</p>

	<p>
		The O Driscoll Clan Gathering has since 1986 been a genuine homecoming
		for all members of the international O Driscoll family as Baltimore
		and the islands is  their ancestral homeland. Click here for Clan

		After visiting the museum and viewing some of the O Driscoll related exhibition material and O Driscoll Archive Collection, there will be lunches, tea, coffee etc. available at bars near the North Harbour. Visits to historic and other sites may be organised in the afternoon. A music session, perhaps a quiz or a visit to historic and archaeological sites or other activities may take place on the day. At 4:30 pm, the ferry leaves Cape Clear for Baltimore. On Saturday night, O Driscoll Clan members usually spend some time chatting with new friends, making contacts and perhaps discussing their common O Driscoll genealogy and heritage. It is also a time for engaging with the local community and relaxing in comfort at local restaurants and pubs.

		By 3 pm Sunday afternoon, O Driscolls will have crowded into Baltimore Square in the shadow of the O Driscoll Castle, Dún na Séad, the pride of all their castles. The name of a new O Driscoll Chieftain is announced every two years and there is the formal handing over of the O Driscoll Chieftains Chain of Office. Great excitement and music follow for a number of hours. Most of the visitors from overseas spend Sunday night gathered together in the village, and next day may perhaps continue with their holiday arrangements around County Cork, Kerry and elsewhere.
