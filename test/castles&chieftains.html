   		<p>The focus of the Annual O Driscoll Clan Gathering is always on people,
		   because all who do attend are coming home to their O Driscoll
		   ancestral home place. Everyone who bears any form of the name Ó
		   Drisceoil / O Driscoll are descended from an O Driscoll, who at one
		   time lived in West County Cork, especially in the area around
		   Baltimore and the islands of Cape Clear, Heir and Sherkin. In this
		   area are the ruins of many O Driscoll castles and other buildings and
		   sites associated with O Driscolls.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Those who attend the O Driscoll Clan Gathering at Baltimore and the
			islands are always welcomed as being part of the family. They are in
			the home place from where one of their O Driscoll ancestors was born
			and from where a subsequent descendant left. No other Irish family
			have remained so long and so strong in numbers in their own place as
			the O Driscolls of West Cork.

		<p style="color: brown; text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 20px;"><b>Who are the Ó Drisceoil / O Driscolls ?</b></p>

		<p>
			Genealogists give the Uí Drisceoil / O Driscoll family a descent from
			Ith son of Bregon, a paternal uncle of Mil who was one of the first to
			settle in Ireland. The Ui Etersceoil or O Driscolls are named from one
			Eterscél who was head of the family sometime in the first half of the
			tenth century or from a later descendant Eterscél, son of Finn, who
			lived in the mid-eleventh century. <a href="general-links.html">Click here</a> for details of Clan websites
			that support and participate in the O Driscoll Clan Gathering at
			Baltimore and the islands, Co. Cork, Ireland.
		</p>

		<p>
			The O Driscolls can boast of their connection to the early Christian
			pilgrim, Saint Ciarán, born in Cape Clear island, who became the
			patron saint not alone of Ossory (Co. Kilkenny and Offaly, but also of
			Cornwall where he is called St. Piran.
		</p>

		<p>
			From the twelfth century, O Driscolls were confined to an area
			consisting of poor land and a long and dangerous coastline, from
			Castlehaven to Baltimore including offshore islands. In their time
			they had seven castles (Tower Houses) within the territory they
			controlled, Dún na Séad, at Baltimore being the ‘jewel’ or the
			principal one. From their castles, they established themselves as
			great mariners on the south coast, engaging in piracy, feuds, warfare
			and controlling some of the richest fishing grounds in Europe.
		</p>

		<p>
			After the Battle of Kinsale 1601, their fortunes of the O Driscolls
			declined, their castles were abandoned and became ruins, the remains
			of a number of which are still to be seen.  The seventeenth century
			Finghin Ó Drisceoil, ‘Fineen the Rover’, although famous in song and
			story, set in train a series of events and land deals which were to
			reduce the O Driscolls to poverty and cause their leaders and many of
			their descendants to emigrate to England, Canada, America, Australia
			and New Zealand.
		</p>

		<p>
			They went as ‘ Wild Geese’ to France and Spain and other places where
			they made a name for themselves in military, ecclesiastical and other
			affairs. In time in Ireland, they adapted to new ways and became
			merchants, journalists, authors, poets, sportmen, educationalists,
			religious and legal figures.  Their contribution to the armed forces,
			religious, economic, scientific, artistic, medical , cultural and
			political life of many countries has been significant. The O Driscoll
			Diaspora is worldwide with members of the Clan still rooted in great
			numbers throughout West Cork.

			Baltimore (Baile an Tighe Mhóir) became the seat of the O Driscoll Mór
			in the mid-thirteenth century.  The castle in Baltimore, known as Dún
			na Séad, was built in 1215 by the English and it is probably the
			oldest of the O Driscoll castles. When exactly it came into their
			hands is not known. It has been completely restored by Patrick and
			Bernadette McCarthy and hosts the Annual O Driscoll Clan Gathering at
			Baltimore. Other O Driscoll castles or tower houses were at Oldcourt,
			Castlehaven, Castlenard, Lettertinlish, Rincolisky, Aghadown, Lough
			Hyne and Ardagh, as well as those on the islands; Dún an Óir at Cape
			Clear, Dún na Long in Sherkin and Dún na nGall in Rinn Garóige or
			Ringarory Island. There was also a fortification at Spanish Island
			which commanded the entrance to the Ilen river.

	 		The mystery of who today should be called ‘The O Driscoll’, the
			hereditary chieftain of the clan still persists and each year at the
			Annual Clan Gathering the subject engages many O Driscolls from far
			and near as they meet with new friends and relations and others who
			can provide them sound family research guidance. In 1986 the West Cork
			O Driscoll community came together at Baltimore to celebrate their
			family heritage and so was launched what has become a highly
			successful annual event.
			Prior to 2005 the Clan Chieftains were selected from O Driscolls who
			were permanently resident in Ireland. The inauguration in 2005 of Dave
			Driscoll of the UK as the first non Irish O Driscoll Chieftain brought
			new life, and excitement to the event and opened the door to the Irish
			Diaspora. While Chieftains can be chosen from any country those chosen
			from Canada, UK and USA have added a wonderful enriching cultural
			dimension to the annual get-together of members of the worldwide O
			Driscoll family.  For a listing of O Driscoll Clan Chieftains, <a href="clan-chieftains.html">Click here</a>
